# CreateLocalizedWordpressPages
SEO stuff - create a lot of localized wordpress pages to offer your service in City, State

I encountered someone looking to pay a pittance per page for someone to manually create thousands of
location-specific pages on their WordPress site -- basic SEO stuff so a potential customer searching
for *service in town, state* would be more likely to see their site. 

I built this quick script to allow the to create their own pages without paying for data entry. It
runs on the WordPress server and uses native functionality (wp-load.php) to create the posts. 

Both the template information and the localization list could be sourced from a file, but the 
individual for whom I created the script preferred the whole thing be self-contained.
